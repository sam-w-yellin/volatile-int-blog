I have spent my career building and shipping embedded software for high-reliability aerospace and autonomous systems. My work is currently running on rocket engines, satellites, and autonomous aircraft.

I was the responsible engineer for several years for the [BE-3U rocket engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRiAEPpQzT0) controller software, and later served as flight software lead at Astranis, where I led the team through development, launch, and on-orbit operations for the first five [MicroGEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrljTHc1Ios) communications satellites. I am currently working on the flight software platform team at [Anduril](https://www.anduril.com/air/air-dominance-and-strike), focused on scaling embedded systems across vehicles and programs.

My expertise is centered on C/C++, Python, and the architecture of mission-critical, resource-constrained systems.
