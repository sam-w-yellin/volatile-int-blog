I have spent my career developing embedded software systems. I have code executing on rocket engines, communication satellites, autonomous aircraft, and more. My expertise is primarily in C/C++, Python, and the architecture of high-reliability, mission-critical systems.

If you have any questions or would like input on your software system or architecture, please reach out!
