Hopefully, the culmination of what we have built presented in the last section of the post sufficiently motivates the complexity tradeoff for projects with many controllers or who need to distribute the development responsibilities of the control laws and hardware interfaces across teams.\nFirst, let’s kick things off with a scenario.\nA Simple Bang-Bang Controller Picture yourself as an embedded software engineer working at a scrappy startup designing a revolutionary new technology with a healthy mix of hardware and software co-development. Your co-worker - a thermal engineer responsible for maintaining the health of a temperature-sensitive component of the system - approaches you, asking for software to regulate the temperature of their system:\nA thermoelectric cooler (henceforth referred to as a TEC) connected to the component that needs to be cooled. The engineer connected this to a simple switch which will apply either 0 or 100% power. A thermocouple connected to the device being cooled to sense the temperature. A microcontroller wired to control the TEC using the thermocouple as feedback. The thermal engineer explains the straightoforward control algorithm requirements.. All their analysis shows that they just need to keep the component between 20 and 80 degrees Celsius. The component generates heat during operation, so the only element needed is the cooler. The temperature is expected to change slowly, so they suspect that it will be sufficient to just occasionally monitor the temperature, and if it gets to 80 degrees, turn on the cooler and keep it on until the thermocouple reports 20 degrees.\nYou write a very minimal program:\n#include #include #include \"gpio.hpp\" #include \"adc.hpp\" void control_tec() { Gpio tec{ 1 }; // TEC is on pin 1 Adc thermocouple{ 2 }; // thermocouple on pin 2 tec.Configure(Gpio::Output); thermocouple.Configure(); while (true) { const auto raw_temp_adc = thermocouple.read(); const auto temp_uc = static_cast\u003cfloat\u003e(raw) * 0.1f; if (temp_uc \u003e= 80) { tec.Set(true); } else if (temp_uc \u003c= 20) { tec.Set(false); } std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::minutes(1)); } } int main() { control_tec(); } This implementation is functional, but it has a number of problems.\nImplementing Controller Scaffolding What happens when the control law needs to change? What about when the GPIO is changed for a PWM output, or when the on-chip ADC is replaced with a more accurate off-chip device?\nAnd what about testability? The folks who write these control laws are often not the embedded software teams. The control law is inextricably tied to the hardware used for gathering feedback and effecting output. Is the controls team expected to maintain simulation infrastructure for hardware to iterate on control laws?\nHow do we make sure this code actually serves all our purposes? It doesn’t appear to handle errors. It doesn’t provide insight into the status of the controller. It doesn’t have any sense of configuration - the bounds are hard-coded. We have no facilities to log state, or understand if our feedback or actuation mechanisms have failed to accomplish their tasks.\nFinally, what about consistency across the codebase? If we are working in a system with lot of controllers - as many embedded systems and embedded software platforms must support - how do we make sure they’re all implemented in a consistent way? consistency is critically important for maintaining developer velocity in complex code bases, and so it is a matter of utmost importance that we do not arbitrarily do the same thing in wildly different ways.\nThese problems can be addressed by providing scaffolding for the domain of control law implementations.\nRequirements for a Generic Controller Requirements for the scaffolding can be derived from the above use cases:\nControl laws shall be independently testable from any specific hardware configuration. Controller feedback and actuation mechanisms shall explicitly handle all IO and configuration errors. Controllers shall emit representations of their current state suitable for logging. The data flow between the feedback, control law, and actuation mechanism shall be explicitly defined in order to enforce consistency. We also have these design goals:\nIt should be easy to write control laws that abide by the requirements. To the extent possible the constraints imposed by the requirements should be checked at compile-time. Components of a Controller The controller consists of three logically distinct components:\nA purely mathematical control law that receives inputs and computes outputs in order to achieve some goal. A feedback mechanism which interacts with some external interface to collect measurements. An output mechanism which effects the values commanded by the control law into the world. In a given step of the controller data flows first into the feedback component. Then, the data is converted to a format useable by the control law which uses the feedback to calculate the next output value. The output value from the controller is converted to the required data type to emit to a physical component.\nflowchart LR S[Feedback Sensor] FB[Feedback Componente.g., AdcFeedback] LAW[Control Lawe.g., BangBangLaw] ACT[Actuator Componente.g., GpioActuator] AHW[Actuator Hardware] S --\u003e|Raw measurement| FB FB --\u003e|Converted measurement| LAW LAW --\u003e|Command / control output| ACT ACT --\u003e|Actuation signal| AHW Let’s ground this in our TEC example. The ADC is the feedback. ADCs read a voltage. The control law for a TEC is going to deal with temperatures in degrees C, so the voltage must be converted to degrees. The control law emits a boolean - the TEC is on or off. For the bang-bang controller discussed earlier, the output GPIO uses the same data type as the controller output.\nIt is now clear that the data types for input and output from the control law constrain the feedback and actuator components.. The control law cannot provide its own adapters - or we have violated the independent testability requirement. The components close to the hardware must implement their own conversion layers.\nTemplate concepts introduced in C++20 are naturally able to express these constraints. Each of these components - feedback, actuator, law - can be defined as a concept.\nControlLaw Interface Let’s start out writing a concept for our most abstract component - the ControlLaw. The concept requires that each law defines its input and output types - Measurement and Command respectively. Laws must also define a State type.\nThere are two required APIs for a ControlLaw:\nInitialize configures the internal ControlLaw state. It must return the initialized state, or a string in the case of an error. Compute takes in a measurement, and returns a tuple of the next Command and its current State. These interfaces enforce two of our requirements - that the controller implements error handling, and that we have visibility into the current state of the controller.\ntemplate \u003ctypename C\u003e concept ControlLaw = requires(C law, const typename C::Measurement\u0026 m) { typename C::Measurement; typename C::Command; typename C::State; { law.Initialize() } -\u003e std::same_as\u003cstd::expected\u003ctypename C::State, std::string\u003e\u003e; { law.Compute(m) } -\u003e std::same_as\u003cstd::expected\u003cstd::pair\u003ctypename C::Command, typename C::State\u003e, std::string\u003e\u003e; }; Notice that the controller is completely independent of the actuator and feedback mechanisms. This decoupling enables our testability requirement - a class abiding by the ControlLaw concept can be instantiated independent of the larger controller infrastructure.\nExternal Interfaces Now let’s implement our Feedback and Actuator concepts. As discussed earlier, these interfaces are dependent on the ControlLaw’s defined data types. This is represented in our concepts as a template parameter for the ControlLaw, from which we extract the Measurement and Command data types:\ntemplate \u003ctypename FB, typename Law\u003e concept Feedback = ControlLaw\u003cLaw\u003e \u0026\u0026 requires(FB fb) { typename FB::State; { fb.Configure() } -\u003e std::same_as\u003cstd::optional\u003cstd::string\u003e\u003e; { fb.Read() } -\u003e std::same_as\u003c std::expected\u003cstd::pair\u003ctypename Law::Measurement, typename FB::State\u003e, std::string\u003e\u003e; { fb.Convert(std::declval\u003ctypename FB::Raw\u003e()) } -\u003e std::same_as\u003ctypename Law::Measurement\u003e; }; template \u003ctypename AC, typename Law\u003e concept Actuator = ControlLaw\u003cLaw\u003e \u0026\u0026 requires(AC ac, const typename Law::Command\u0026 cmd) { typename AC::State; { ac.Configure() } -\u003e std::same_as\u003cstd::optional\u003cstd::string\u003e\u003e; { ac.Write(cmd) } -\u003e std::same_as\u003cstd::expected\u003ctypename AC::State, std::string\u003e\u003e; { ac.Convert(std::declval\u003ctypename Law::Command\u003e()) } -\u003e std::same_as\u003ctypename AC::State\u003e; }; These concepts closely mirror each other. They are designed to encapsulate external-facing dependencies and abstract away conversion to the ControlLawtypes. The interface entails:\nA Configure function that ensures the output interfaces are ready for control and returns a string on error. A function to interface with the external world - Read and Write for the Feedback and Actuator interfaces respectively. A Convert function that goes from the respective internal type to the data type expected by the template ControlLaw. Just as in the ControlLaw concept, std::expected and std::optional return types are used to enforce error handling and state reporting.\nIntegrated Controller Finally, we implement an integrated Controller class. This class is templated on a specific set of Actuator, Feedback, and ControlLaw concept implementations. It orchestrates the dataflow between components and exposes the external interface to the represented controller.\ntemplate \u003cControlLaw Law, Feedback\u003cLaw\u003e FB, Actuator\u003cLaw\u003e ACT\u003e class Controller { public: using Measurement = typename Law::Measurement; using Command = typename Law::Command; Controller(FB\u0026 feedback, ACT\u0026 actuator, Law\u0026 law) : fb_(feedback), act_(actuator), law_(law) {} std::expected\u003ctypename Law::State, std::string\u003e Initialize() { if (auto err = fb_.Configure()) return std::unexpected(*err); if (auto err = act_.Configure()) return std::unexpected(*err); auto law_state = law_.Initialize(); if (!law_state.has_value()) return std::unexpected(law_state.error()); return law_state.value(); } std::expected\u003cControllerState\u003cFB, Law, ACT\u003e, std::string\u003e Step() { auto fb_result = fb_.Read(); if (!fb_result.has_value()) return std::unexpected(fb_result.error()); auto [measurement, fb_state] = *fb_result; auto law_result = law_.Compute(measurement); if (!law_result.has_value()) return std::unexpected(law_result.error()); auto [command, law_state] = *law_result; auto act_result = act_.Write(command); if (!act_result.has_value()) return std::unexpected(act_result.error()); auto act_state = *act_result; ControllerState\u003cFB, Law, ACT\u003e state{ .feedback_state = fb_state, .control_state = law_state, .actuator_state = act_state}; return state; } private: FB\u0026 fb_; ACT\u0026 act_; Law\u0026 law_; }; Revisiting the Bang-Bang Controller All the pieces are now in place to implement controllers using our generic template scaffolding. The following example implements the simple bang-bang controller for a TEC discussed earlier.\nFirst - we need to create concrete implementations of our ADC feedback, GPIO actuation, and bang-bang control law concepts. The implementations are included below without much exposition - they are fairly straightforward components.\nFile: example/components/feedback_controller/plugins/feedback/include/adc_feedback.hpp #pragma once #include \"adc_interface.hpp\" #include \"feedback_controller_interface.hpp\" template \u003cControlLaw LAW, typename Converter\u003e struct AdcFeedback { using Measurement = typename LAW::Measurement; using Raw = uint16_t; using State = std::pair\u003cMeasurement, Raw\u003e; AdcFeedback(Adc\u0026 adc, Converter converter) : adc_(adc), Convert(converter) {} std::expected\u003cstd::pair\u003cMeasurement, State\u003e, std::string\u003e Read() { std::expected\u003cRaw, std::string\u003e maybe_raw = adc_.ReadRaw(); if (!maybe_raw.has_value()) { return std::unexpected(maybe_raw.error()); } const auto\u0026 raw = maybe_raw.value(); Measurement m = Convert(raw); return std::pair{m, std::pair{m, raw}}; } std::optional\u003cstd::string\u003e Configure() { const auto configure_result = adc_.Configure(); if (configure_result.has_value()) { return std::make_optional( std::format(\"ADC configure failed: {}\", configure_result.value())); } return {}; } Converter Convert; private: Adc\u0026 adc_; };\nFile: example/components/feedback_controller/plugins/actuators/include/gpio_actuator.hpp #pragma once #include \"feedback_controller_interface.hpp\" #include \"gpio_interface.hpp\" template \u003cControlLaw LAW, typename Converter\u003e class GpioActuator { public: using Command = typename LAW::Command; using State = bool; GpioActuator(Gpio\u0026 gpio, Converter converter) : gpio_(gpio), Convert(converter) {} std::expected\u003cState, std::string\u003e Write(const Command\u0026 cmd) { State gpio_state = Convert(cmd); const auto err = gpio_.Set(gpio_state); if (err.has_value()) { return std::unexpected(std::format(\"Failed to set GPIO: {}\", err.value())); } return gpio_state; } std::optional\u003cstd::string\u003e Configure() { const auto configure_result = gpio_.Configure(Gpio::Output); if (configure_result.has_value()) { return std::make_optional( std::format(\"GPIO configure failed: {}\", configure_result.value())); } return {}; } Converter Convert; private: Gpio\u0026 gpio_; };\nFile: example/components/feedback_controller/plugins/laws/include/bangbang.hpp #pragma once #include \"feedback_controller_interface.hpp\" struct BangBangLaw { using Measurement = int32_t; using Command = bool; struct State { Command last_command{}; }; struct Config { Measurement min_threshold; Measurement max_threshold; }; BangBangLaw(Measurement min_th, Measurement max_th) { config_.min_threshold = min_th; config_.max_threshold = max_th; } std::expected\u003cState, std::string\u003e Initialize() { State s{}; s.last_command = false; return s; } std::expected\u003cstd::pair\u003cCommand, State\u003e, std::string\u003e Compute(const Measurement\u0026 m) { if (m \u003e= config_.max_threshold) { state_.last_command = true; } else if (m \u003c= config_.min_threshold) { state_.last_command = false; } return std::make_pair(state_.last_command, state_); } State state_; Config config_; };\nIt is worth noting the framework is flexible for whatever configuration any given aspect of the controller requires. In this case, we provide min and max thresholds for the bang-bang controller.\nWith these components - and the simulated concrete ADC and GPIO interfaces defined by the (linked GitHub repo)[https://github.com/sam-w-yellin/feedback-controller] - we can actually instantiate and execute a controller. Instantiation is simple:\n// Simulated hardware SimulatedAdc adc; SimulatedGpio gpio; // Bang-bang control law BangBangLaw law(20 /* min */, 80 /* max */); // ADC Feedback auto convert_adc = [](uint16_t raw) -\u003e BangBangLaw::Measurement { return static_cast\u003cBangBangLaw::Measurement\u003e(raw) / 10; }; AdcFeedback\u003cBangBangLaw, decltype(convert_adc)\u003e feedback(adc, convert_adc); // GPIO Actuator auto convert_gpio = [](bool cmd) -\u003e BangBangLaw::Command { return cmd; }; GpioActuator\u003cBangBangLaw, decltype(convert_gpio)\u003e actuator(gpio, convert_gpio); // Integrated controller Controller\u003cBangBangLaw, decltype(feedback), decltype(actuator)\u003e controller(feedback, actuator, law); We can now use the controller object to enact our control - first using the Initialize API to setup the hardware and control laws, and then the Step function to read inputs into and write outputs from the control law.\nLet’s briefly explore what kinds of errors we get if we violate our concepts. One of the constraints is that our Convert functions map to the types expected by the templated ControlLaw. So, instead of converting the ADC read to an int32_t (implicit through the BangBangLaw::Measurement), let’s try converting to a float:\nauto convert_adc = [](uint16_t raw) -\u003e float { return static_cast\u003cfloat\u003e(raw) / 10; }; AdcFeedback\u003cBangBangLaw, decltype(convert_adc)\u003e feedback(adc, convert_adc); We’re going to get a compile-time error - and if you’re used to C++ templates you’ll agree this error is much nicer than errors you get without concepts:\n/Users/syellin/blog/examples/feedback-controller/example/bangbang_sim/main.cpp:85:5: error: constraints not satisfied for class template 'Controller' [with Law = BangBangLaw, FB = AdcFeedback",

      Implementing a Generic Closed-Loop Controller in Modern C&#43;&#43;

  <div class="post-content"><p>In this post, we&rsquo;re going to implement a generic interface capable of implementing a wide variety of closed-loop control systems. We&rsquo;ll end with a controller capable of implementing whatever algorithm you&rsquo;d want, with configurable setpoints, consistent error handling, and support for logging using modern C++ concepts.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, note that the final code is not simple. In the course of reading, you may balk at the complexity introduced for the sake of consistent abstraction. Hopefully, the culmination of what we have built presented in the last section of the post sufficiently motivates the complexity tradeoff for projects with many controllers or who need to distribute the development responsibilities of the control laws and hardware interfaces across teams.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s kick things off with a scenario.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-bang-bang-controller">A Simple Bang-Bang Controller<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-simple-bang-bang-controller">#</a></h2>
<p>Picture yourself as an embedded software engineer working at a scrappy startup designing a revolutionary new technology with a healthy mix of hardware and software co-development. Your co-worker - a thermal engineer responsible for maintaining the health of a temperature-sensitive component of the system - approaches you, asking for software to regulate the temperature of their system:</p>
<ul>
<li>A thermoelectric cooler (henceforth referred to as a TEC) connected to the component that needs to be cooled. The engineer connected this to a simple switch which will apply either 0 or 100% power.</li>
<li>A thermocouple connected to the device being cooled to sense the temperature.</li>
<li>A microcontroller wired to control the TEC using the thermocouple as feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thermal engineer explains the straightoforward control algorithm requirements.. All their analysis shows that they just need to keep the component between 20 and 80 degrees Celsius. The component generates heat during operation, so the only element needed is the cooler. The temperature is expected to change slowly, so they suspect that it will be sufficient to just occasionally monitor the temperature, and if it gets to 80 degrees, turn on the cooler and keep it on until the thermocouple reports 20 degrees.</p>
<p>You write a very minimal program:</p>

<h2 id="implementing-controller-scaffolding">Implementing Controller Scaffolding<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementing-controller-scaffolding">#</a></h2>
<p>What happens when the control law needs to change? What about when the GPIO is changed for a PWM output, or when the on-chip ADC is replaced with a more accurate off-chip device?</p>
<p>And what about testability? The folks who write these control laws are often not the embedded software teams. The control law is inextricably tied to the hardware used for gathering feedback and effecting output. Is the controls team expected to maintain simulation infrastructure for hardware to iterate on control laws?</p>
<p>How do we make sure this code actually serves all our purposes? It doesn&rsquo;t appear to handle errors. It doesn&rsquo;t provide insight into the status of the controller. It doesn&rsquo;t have any sense of configuration - the bounds are hard-coded. We have no facilities to log state, or understand if our feedback or actuation mechanisms have failed to accomplish their tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, what about consistency across the codebase? If we are working in a system with lot of controllers - as many embedded systems and embedded software platforms must support - how do we make sure they&rsquo;re all implemented in a consistent way? consistency is critically important for maintaining developer velocity in complex code bases, and so it is a matter of utmost importance that we do not arbitrarily do the same thing in wildly different ways.</p>
<p>These problems can be addressed by providing <em>scaffolding</em> for the domain of control law implementations.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-for-a-generic-controller">Requirements for a Generic Controller<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#requirements-for-a-generic-controller">#</a></h3>
<p>Requirements for the scaffolding can be derived from the above use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Control laws shall be independently testable from any specific hardware configuration.</li>
<li>Controller feedback and actuation mechanisms shall explicitly handle all IO and configuration errors.</li>
<li>Controllers shall emit representations of their current state suitable for logging.</li>
<li>The data flow between the feedback, control law, and actuation mechanism shall be explicitly defined in order to enforce consistency.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also have these design goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should be <em>easy</em> to write control laws that abide by the requirements.</li>
<li>To the extent possible the constraints imposed by the requirements should be checked at compile-time.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="components-of-a-controller">Components of a Controller<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#components-of-a-controller">#</a></h3>
<p>The controller consists of three logically distinct components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A purely mathematical control law that receives inputs and computes outputs in order to achieve some goal.</li>
<li>A feedback mechanism which interacts with some external interface to collect measurements.</li>
<li>An output mechanism which effects the values commanded by the control law into the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a given step of the controller data flows first into the feedback component. Then, the data is converted to a format useable by the control law which uses the feedback to calculate the next output value. The output value from the controller is converted to the required data type to emit to a physical component.</p>

  FB -->|Converted measurement| LAW
  LAW -->|Command / control output| ACT
  ACT -->|Actuation signal| AHW

</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ground this in our TEC example. The ADC is the feedback. ADCs read a voltage. The control law for a TEC is going to deal with temperatures in degrees C, so the voltage must be converted to degrees. The control law emits a boolean - the TEC is on or off. For the bang-bang controller discussed earlier, the output GPIO uses the same data type as the controller output.</p>
<p>It is now clear that the data types for input and output from the control law <em>constrain</em> the feedback and actuator components.. The control law cannot provide its own adapters - or we have violated the independent testability requirement. The components close to the hardware must implement their own conversion layers.</p>
<p>Template concepts introduced in C++20 are naturally able to express these constraints. Each of these components - feedback, actuator, law - can be defined as a <code>concept</code>.</p>
<h4 id="controllaw-interface">ControlLaw Interface<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#controllaw-interface">#</a></h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start out writing a concept for our most abstract component - the <code>ControlLaw</code>. The concept requires that each law defines its input and output types - <code>Measurement</code> and <code>Command</code> respectively. Laws must also define a <code>State</code> type.</p>
<p>There are two required APIs for a <code>ControlLaw</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Initialize</code> configures the internal <code>ControlLaw</code> state. It must return the initialized state, or a string in the case of an error.</li>
<li><code>Compute</code> takes in a measurement, and returns a tuple of the next <code>Command</code> and its current <code>State</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These interfaces enforce two of our requirements - that the controller implements error handling, and that we have visibility into the current state of the controller.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that the controller is completely independent of the actuator and feedback mechanisms.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These concepts closely mirror each other. They are designed to encapsulate external-facing dependencies and abstract away conversion to the <code>ControlLaw</code>types. The interface entails:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Configure</code> function that ensures the output interfaces are ready for control and returns a string on error.</li>
<li>A function to interface with the external world - <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code> for the <code>Feedback</code> and <code>Actuator</code> interfaces respectively.</li>
<li>A <code>Convert</code> function that goes from the respective internal type to the data type expected by the template <code>ControlLaw</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as in the <code>ControlLaw</code> concept, <code>std::expected</code> and <code>std::optional</code> return types are used to enforce error handling and state reporting.</p>
<h4 id="integrated-controller">Integrated Controller<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#integrated-controller">#</a></h4>
<p>Finally, we implement an integrated <code>Controller</code> class. This class is templated on a specific set of <code>Actuator</code>, <code>Feedback</code>, and <code>ControlLaw</code> concept implementations. It orchestrates the dataflow between components and exposes the external interface to the represented controller.</p>

<p>All the pieces are now in place to implement controllers using our generic template scaffolding. The following example implements the simple bang-bang controller for a TEC discussed earlier.</p>
<p>First - we need to create concrete implementations of our ADC feedback, GPIO actuation, and bang-bang control law concepts. The implementations are included below without much exposition - they are fairly straightforward components.</p>

<p>It is worth noting the framework is flexible for whatever configuration any given aspect of the controller requires. In this case, we provide min and max thresholds for the bang-bang controller.</p>
<p>With these components - and the simulated concrete ADC and GPIO interfaces defined by the (linked GitHub repo)[https://github.com/sam-w-yellin/feedback-controller]  - we can actually instantiate and execute a controller. Instantiation is simple:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s briefly explore what kinds of errors we get if we violate our concepts. One of the constraints is that our <code>Convert</code> functions map to the types expected by the templated <code>ControlLaw</code>.

<p>After building and executing this simulation, and running the included <code>graph_log.py</code> script - you&rsquo;ll see an output like this:</p>

<h2 id="exercises-for-the-reader">Exercises for the Reader<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercises-for-the-reader">#</a></h2>
<p>I encourage you to try extending this functionality yourself! Consider these two challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement the <code>Convert</code> function at compile-time rather than as a lambda passed into the constructor.</li>
<li>Enable runtime configuration of the controller via dependency inversion by creating a base class for each of the concepts.</li>
</ol>
<p>These exercises both may be very useful to some applications, and are great ways to apply the patterns learned in this post.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>The design we&rsquo;ve implemented demonstrates all the requirements and design goals we set out to achieve. If you are operating in an ecosystem of control laws, this pattern is almost certainly useful. I have implemented similar patterns at multiple organizations and reaped the benefits of consistent control interfaces and implementations at scale. The benefits of cleanly defined component boundaries and separate responsibilities, enforced error checking and state exposure, and swappable feedback/actuator/law implementations come at the cost of complexity. Not only is this implementation more verbose than the simple controller we saw at the beginning - it is undoubtedly more complex. Understanding this implementation fully demands quite a lot from the code maintainers. To reaffirm - this solution makes sense in an <em>ecosystem</em> of controllers.</p>
<p>I hope the patterns reviewed here are useable in your own code. The feedback controller interface is available on <a href="https://github.com/sam-w-yellin/feedback-controller">GitHub</a> as a single-header to anyone who wants to use it or try out the exercises outlined above. The simulation framework included in the repo also could prove useful to anyone iterating on controllers.</p>
